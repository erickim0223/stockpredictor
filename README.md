# Stock Predictor
This project is a stock predictor to determine whether or not a stock should be bought. I made this project to use what I learned in my Intro to Machine Learning course and hopefully create a tool that can predict a stock's price. It also provides other key economic indicators that will help me keep up to date with today's economic state. 
Languages/Technologies used: 
- Python
- Streamlit

Challenges:
- Downloading all the python libraries (There was trouble in downloading the tensorflow library)
- Learning Streamlit framework/deploying my app

Plan to add: <br>
- Enhance model of predictor
- Add a way to add a searched stock to my list
- Maybe, have an input select to choose which economic indicator/stock to look at one at a time
- More style
