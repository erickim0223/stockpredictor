# Stock Predictor
This project is a stock predictor to determine whether or not a stock should be bought. I made this project to use what I learned in my Intro to Machine Learning course and hopefully create a tool that can predict a stock's price. 
Languages/Technologies used: 
- Python
- Streamlit 
<br>

Challenges:
- Downloading all the python libraries (There was trouble in downloading the tensorflow library)
- Learning Streamlit framework/deploying my app

Plan to add: <br>
- More tabs like current economic data (inflation, interest rates, etc.)
- Search a stock and get current data
- Fix model/date of predictor
- Nav bar
- More style
